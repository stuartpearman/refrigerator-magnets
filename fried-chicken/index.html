          i remember<br><br>
          my brother’s eye socket<br><br>
          filled with blood, a cascading<br><br>
          waterfall of red i couldn’t see through.<br><br>
          i couldn’t tell whether he had eyes still.<br><br>
          we ate fried chicken—me,<br><br>
          my sister, our friends—<br><br>
          while my parents drove my brother<br><br>
          to the ER. the chicken felt stuck<br><br>
          inside my throat and it was<br><br>
          hard to swallow.<br><br>
          i never ate fried chicken again.<br><br>
          my brother has both eyes still.<br><br>
          he was stitched back together,<br><br>
          but he still has<br><br>
          a scar, interrupting<br><br>
          the arch of his eyebrow.<br><br>
          —<br><br>
          my sister became deaf as a baby, when she had meningitis.<br><br>
          my parents took sign language classes,<br><br>
          and then, one day, her hearing returned.<br><br>
          —<br><br>
          my brother has eyes.<br><br>
          my sister has ears.<br><br>
          a miracle.<br><br>
          i think that i am the only member<br><br>
          of my family who thinks<br><br>
          about this often,<br><br>
          still.<br><br>
