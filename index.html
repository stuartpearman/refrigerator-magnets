      this is a tribute
      to my sister
      Suzanne
      who left us too soon
      pick a poem to the right
      and make it your own

      <h1>LA Dreams</h1>
      <p>
        my feet never hurt
        at first.

        i spent my walks rehearsing

        how i would recount them

        someday

        when i “made it.” i thought,

        someday this will be the prologue

        to my cinderella story.

        <h1>Brain to Brain</h1>
        <p>
          how long will it be

          until there is no one left alive

          who appreciates books, the feel

          of them, the binding—

          until screens feel

          more natural

          than pages

          will we still read or will we

          just watch videos or holograms

          or only transfer thoughts

          from brain to brain

      <li class="poem3">
        <h1>growing up</h1>
        <p>
          when i was one, my parents called me “pumpkin.”

          when i was two, my sister was born, and i was pissed.

          when i was three, my sister became deaf and then later miraculously regained her

          hearing.

        <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
        <p>
          we ate fried chicken
          me,
          my sister
          our friends

          while my parents drove my brother

          to the ER.

          the chicken felt stuck

          inside my throat and it was

          hard to swallow.

          i never ate fried chicken again.
        </p>
