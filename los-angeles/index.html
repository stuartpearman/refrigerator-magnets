          before I moved to los angeles,<br><br>
          my mother took me shopping<br><br>
          for blazers, silk dresses printed<br><br>
          with flowers, sandals with<br><br>
          too-steep wedge heels.<br><br>
          we collected shades of turquoise,<br><br>
          terra cotta, peach—a palette<br><br>
          we associated with the southwest.<br><br>
          we were buying things to match<br><br>
          my future home, as we imagined it;<br><br>
          to suit the warmer climate;<br><br>
          to clothe me for the job I didn’t have yet<br><br>
          but imagined I would soon.<br><br>
          my mom insisted i try on<br><br>
          a denim jacket, pale pink. i knew i’d<br><br>
          never wear it but forgot that when<br><br>
          the sales associate at macy’s<br><br>
          said i looked “so L.A.” in it.<br><br>
          the blazers led a lonely life<br><br>
          inside my closet; the high heels<br><br>
          gathered dust. i needed flat shoes<br><br>
          that would carry me four miles<br><br>
          every morning to my internship.<br><br>
          my feet never hurt—at first.<br><br>
          i spent my walks rehearsing<br><br>
          how i would recount them<br><br>
          someday<br><br>
          when i “made it.” i thought,<br><br>
          someday this will be the prologue<br><br>
          to my cinderella story.<br><br>
          gradually, though, my feet<br><br>
          began to lose their willingness<br><br>
          to bear my weight. the sun dimmed.<br><br>
          and yes, my soles were sore<br><br>
          the day i packed my dreams inside a car<br><br>
          and drove back east.<br><br>
